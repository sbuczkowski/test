Introducing a new file to be first commit in an 
eventual squash of commits

Making first edit to be commited separately on local branch but squashed
on merge to master and subsequent push to origin


And making a second edit and commit cycle


ok, try again but with rebase instead of merge


and a second rebase edit

Ok, now try with rebase to squash the commits

and a second commit to rebase and squash

and another test. will make several small commits and squash them when I merge
into master, then make several more and try to merge into master. Mayhem
should ensue.

and a second change

and a third change (then merge/rebase/squash)
